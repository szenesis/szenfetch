#Szenfetch

A detailed but simple command-line system information tool. 
The tool requires bash to work (but can be used by any shell as long as bash is in the system).

##Installation

Clone repo:
```bash or any shell
  git clone https://github.com/szenesis/szenfetch
```

Enter tool directory:

```bash
  cd szenfetch
```

Grant run permission to install script:

```bash
  chmod +x install.sh
```

Run installation script;

```bash
  ./install.sh
```

After succesfully installing, you are free to use command:

```bash
  szenfetch
```

The default install directory is:
```
/usr/local/bin
```
##Note

Tool was created from my personal need of a simple fetching tool that worked in any distro (including immutable distros) and was not flashy or fancy. It just gives information I usually need from a PC.
Tool was created to the best of my knowledge. There is the possiblity of mistakes in the script. Let me know if you encounter any bugs or errors. Fetch away!
